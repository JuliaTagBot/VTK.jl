Proof of concept: Julia wrapper for VTK
======================================

WARNING: This repo will be rebased to a clean history when the full wrapper is ready.

Background
==========

Several new functions have been added to Clang.jl to allow querying the vtable index and mangled name for C++ methods.
Please see the branch wip\_testing in Clang.jl and [this ticket](https://github.com/ihnorton/Clang.jl/issues/20)
for implementation details.
